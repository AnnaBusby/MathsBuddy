Honestly you probably wont find anything helpful here, this is my first attempt at using GitHub, I am in the early days off learing to code using Swift. I am following a course by HackingWithSwift called 100 days of SwiftUI, i'm currrently on day 35 and I'm working on a milestone challenge.
In this challenge I need to build an "edutainment" app for kids to practice their multipe times table.
